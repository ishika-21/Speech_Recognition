Unique Audio Analysis Dashboard

# About
This project is made using a speech recognition API, ‘Assembly AI’ on audio data.
A dashboard is designed that visualizes all the key information from the audio content including  Automatic Audio Transcription, Sentiment Analysis, Word Cloud for the most frequently used words, Automatic Content Summary and highlights of most important phrases and words this audio. 

As a sample example, audio of a KenJee’s youtube video is taken. I have also tested the performance of my app on a pop song - ‘I don’t wanna live forever’ by Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik.
